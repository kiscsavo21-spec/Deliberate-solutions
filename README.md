Goal:
A Python-based dashboard that pulls data from project management tools (like Jira, Trello, or GitHub) and visualizes team performance, progress, and risk indicators â€” all in one place.
Problem:
Project Managers often switch between multiple tools to check progress, velocity, and risk metrics. Manual reporting wastes time and leads to inconsistent insights.

Solution:
A single dashboard that aggregates and visualizes project data, helping PMs quickly identify trends, bottlenecks, and workload imbalances.
